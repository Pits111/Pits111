### Hi, I'm Isa 

What started with **Pie in the sky (Pits)** finally became reality. I started learning to code! 💥

Having worked as a project manager, product owner, scrum master and policy advisor, I have gained a bunch
of tech and soft skills throughout the years. Now I am improving my JS and React skills. 👩‍💻

Unitl now, learning to code has been highly challenging and fun at the same time! 🚀

Exactly my cup of tea. 🍵👌

Cheers to you
